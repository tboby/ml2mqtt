## ML2MQTT

### What is ML2MQTT?

ML2MQTT is a user-friendly machine learning system designed to integrate seamlessly with MQTT. It is tailored for users with minimal programming or machine learning expertise, making it easy to set up while still being powerful. Knowledge of MQTT helps, and Node-RED is now an optional legacy compatibility path rather than the primary setup flow.

### Standalone Docker Quick Start

ML2MQTT can now run as a regular Docker container outside Home Assistant while keeping the existing Home Assistant workflow intact.

- Copy `ml2mqtt/settings.example.json` to `ml2mqtt/settings.json` if you want file-based config, or set `MQTT_SERVER`, `MQTT_PORT`, `MQTT_USERNAME`, and `MQTT_PASSWORD` as environment variables.
- Persist model data by mounting a volume to `/data`.
- Home Assistant ingress handling is disabled by default in standalone mode and still enabled automatically when the add-on's `/data/options.json` is present.
- The standalone/root `Dockerfile` now uses Canonical's chiselled `ubuntu/python` runtime; the Home Assistant add-on image under `ml2mqtt/Dockerfile` stays on the existing base for broader architecture coverage.
- GitHub Actions publishes the standalone image to `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>` with `sha-*` tags on pushes, `latest` from the default branch, and git tag names on tagged releases.

Run with Docker Compose:

```yaml
docker compose up --build
```

Run with Docker directly:

```bash
docker build -t ml2mqtt .
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 \
  -e MQTT_SERVER=mosquitto \
  -e MQTT_PORT=1883 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  ml2mqtt
```

For local Python development, use `uv`:

```bash
cd ml2mqtt
uv sync
uv run python app.py
```

### Local Home Assistant Devcontainer Workflow

This repo now includes a local Home Assistant development stack under `.devcontainer/` for working on the custom integration and the ML2MQTT app together.

What it starts for you:

- `workspace`: Python 3.11 development container for editing, `uv`, and running the app, with the locked Python environment baked into the image.
- `homeassistant`: an official Home Assistant container with `custom_components/ml2mqtt` mounted live from this repo.
- `mosquitto`: a local MQTT broker already wired into Home Assistant and the app helper script, also exposed on `localhost:1884` for host-side testing without colliding with an existing local broker.

Recommended flow:

1. Open the repo in a devcontainer-capable editor and reopen in the container using `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
2. Wait for `.devcontainer/post-create.sh` to finish the local repo setup and for `.devcontainer/ensure-ml2mqtt-running.sh` to auto-start the app inside the workspace container.
3. Open the ML2MQTT UI at `http://localhost:15000` and confirm it responds.
4. Open `http://localhost:18123` and complete the normal Home Assistant onboarding flow.
5. In Home Assistant, add the `MQTT` integration first and point it at broker `mosquitto` on port `1883`.
6. Then add the `ML2MQTT` integration once. It should default to `http://workspace:5000`; if not, enter that app URL manually.
7. If you want to publish test messages from the host, connect your MQTT client to `localhost:1884`.
8. For quick model testing, use the built-in helpers `sensor.ml2mqtt_test_temperature_sensor`, `sensor.ml2mqtt_test_humidity_sensor`, `sensor.ml2mqtt_test_illuminance_sensor`, and `sensor.ml2mqtt_test_motion_score`, plus the preset scripts `script.ml2mqtt_test_preset_kitchen`, `script.ml2mqtt_test_preset_living_room`, and `script.ml2mqtt_test_preset_study`.
9. Use `Configure` on that integration whenever you want to add another ML2MQTT model instead of creating a whole new integration entry.
10. On each model device page, `Ingested Sensors` shows the bound entities and their current values without creating duplicate mirror sensors; `Learning Mode` lets you switch between Off/Lazy/Eager, `Training Samples` shows model type and per-label counts, and the device also exposes a direct edit-page link plus `Capture Sample` when you want to record the current preset again without changing any source values.

Notes:

- The devcontainer auto-starts ML2MQTT in a stable single-process mode. If you want Flask debug reloads while editing, run `ML2MQTT_DEBUG=true bash .devcontainer/start-ml2mqtt.sh` manually in the workspace container.
- The bundled MQTT broker allows anonymous local connections on `mosquitto:1883` inside Docker and `localhost:1884` from the host.
- Current Home Assistant versions configure the MQTT broker through the UI, not `configuration.yaml`.
- The `ML2MQTT` integration must connect to the app from inside the Home Assistant container, so use `http://workspace:5000` rather than the host URL `http://localhost:15000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
- The integration now groups multiple ML2MQTT models under one shared app URL entry; old duplicate entries are merged automatically on reload.
- Raw preprocessor-stage recordings are now treated as the editable source dataset: export them with `GET /api/v1/models/<model>/raw-observations`, import them with `POST /api/v1/models/<model>/raw-observations/import`, rebuild derived training observations with `POST /api/v1/models/<model>/raw-observations/replay`, or clear the stored raw dataset with `DELETE /api/v1/models/<model>/raw-observations`.
- The devcontainer Home Assistant config also seeds a few test helpers and preset scripts so you can train a model without wiring up real devices first.
- Re-running the same preset script does not change entity states, so use the model's `Capture Sample` button if you want to record another identical training example.
- If you change `ml2mqtt/pyproject.toml` or `ml2mqtt/uv.lock`, rebuild the devcontainer so the workspace image refreshes the Python environment.
- Home Assistant runtime files are stored under `.devcontainer/homeassistant/` and only the tracked config YAML files are kept in git.
- If you want service logs from the host, run `docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml logs -f homeassistant`.

### Home Assistant-First Setup

For Home Assistant users, the preferred path is now:

1. Run the ML2MQTT app or add-on so the Flask UI and MQTT runtime are available.
2. Install the `ML2MQTT` custom integration from HACS.
3. Point the integration at the ML2MQTT app API.
4. Either bind Home Assistant entities to an existing model or create a new model from selected entities.
5. Let the integration create the trainer select, prediction sensor, confidence sensor, and bridge status sensor automatically.

The existing Node-RED export remains available as a compatibility path for raw MQTT or manual orchestration setups.

### Adapter API Access Model

The first adapter API release is a versioned local HTTP API under `/api/v1/*` on the ML2MQTT app.

- Intended use: trusted local Home Assistant or Docker environments.
- Initial auth model: no app-side auth is enabled by default.
- Expected deployment: provide the Home Assistant integration with a reachable ML2MQTT app URL.
- Runtime transport: MQTT remains the prediction and training transport; the app API is only for model discovery, creation, binding, and bridge status.

### What Problems Does Machine Learning Solve?

Traditional programming relies on fixed sets of rules, which can make it difficult to account for multiple sensors and complex conditions. Machine learning simplifies this by learning from sensor data and automatically identifying patterns. 

For example, in the [Bermuda project](https://github.com/agittins/bermuda), the system determines the location of a phone based on Bluetooth signal strength from multiple sensors. Using a traditional logic-based setup, it simply picks the sensor with the strongest signal to determine the location of a phone. Machine learning can assess all sensor data at once, identifying more nuanced patterns and providing more accurate predictions. 

With ML2MQTT, you can go even further by defining additional zones that weren’t initially possible in Bermuda’s logic-based system, and combine it with other sensors such as lights being switched on or off, or power consumption from an Emporia Vue.

### How Does It Work?

Let’s walk through a simple example to illustrate how ML2MQTT works.

**Scenario:**
- You have 6 Bluetooth sensors installed throughout your house.
- You want to track presence in 8 rooms.

**Step 0: Install ML2MQTT**
- Navigate to the Addons section of Home Assistant, click on Add-On Store and in the overflow icon at the top right select Repositories.
- Add https://github.com/donutsoft/ml2mqtt as a new repository.
- ML2MQTT should appear in the store.
- Once installed, go to the configuration page of ML2MQTT and ensure the MQTT connection details are set correctly.

Upon launching you should see this window

**Step 1: Create Your Model**
- Click **Add Model** and enter a name for your model (e.g., "Paul-Presence") and add labels for each room.
- If you're creating the model from the Home Assistant integration, select the source entities there and let ML2MQTT derive the initial input count from that selection.
- If you're using the app UI directly, specify the initial number of input sensors manually. In my example it's 6.

**Step 2: Bind Entities in Home Assistant (Preferred)**
- Install the ML2MQTT custom integration through HACS.
- Add the integration and enter the reachable ML2MQTT app URL.
- Choose an existing model to bind, or create a new model from selected Home Assistant entities.
- The integration will automatically create the trainer select, prediction sensor, confidence sensor, and bridge status sensor.
- When a bound source entity changes, the integration publishes the same snapshot payload that ML2MQTT already understands over MQTT.

**Legacy Step 2: Configure Node-RED (Compatibility Path)**
- Click **Edit** and go to Node-RED. The source code for a NodeRed flow is automatically created for you.

![NodeRed Settings](images/nodered.png)

- Click **Copy to Clipboard**, then open Node-RED. Create a new flow, and import the code from your clipboard (CTRL+I on Windows or CMD+I on Mac).

Initially, the nodes will look like a jumbled mess. Reorganize them so they are more structured, as shown below:

![Node Red configuration image](images/nodes.png)

Before proceeding, it’s important to understand how these nodes work:
- The "ADD ALL SOURCE ENTITIES HERE" node will trigger every time a sensor value changes.
- It will then collect data from each sensor specified in the "CHANGE ME TO A SOURCE ENTITY" nodes.
- Once all sensor values are collected, they are sent to ML2MQTT for processing.

This means you have to specify every source entity **twice**. Once in the "CHANGE ME TO A SOURCE ENTITY" node to retrieve its value, and once in the "ADD ALL SOURCE ENTITIES HERE" node to ensure that every time a sensor value changes, all sensor values are sent to ML2MQTT.

In the example below, we’ve added two sensor entities to the "ADD ALL SOURCE ENTITIES HERE" node:
![Configure multiple entities](images/configure-multiple-entities.png)

Before saving, click on every node with the Red triangle and configure it for your server. Look for red boxes, those need to be completed before you can proceed. 
![Missing fields](images/missing-value.png)
You'll still have one red triangle for the Trainer node (that's labeled Ignore error on first deploy). This is because it's referencing a node that hasn't been added to Home Assistant yet, but once you deploy this should go away.

**Step 3: Configure MQTT in ML2MQTT**
- Go back to ML2MQTT and open the MQTT section.
- Verify that messages are being received. The screen does not auto-refresh, so you may need to click the refresh button a few times.

![MQTT configuration](images/mqtt-config.png)

If no data is appearing, ensure that your sensors are actively sending data. You can also check the Logs panel for any error messages.

**Step 4: Training Your Model**
- If you're using the Home Assistant integration, add the auto-created trainer, prediction, confidence, and bridge status entities to a dashboard.
- If you're using the legacy Node-RED path, add the source entities, the trainer selector, and the prediction sensor manually.
- Walk around your home and label each room. Select the correct room label on the training selector, and let ML2MQTT record observations. When you're about to change rooms, select disabled first and only start training once you're in the new room to avoid conflicting labels.

![Home Assistant Dashboard](images/homeassistant-training.png)

Once you’ve collected around 1000 observations, you can switch the learning mode from **Eager Learning** to **Lazy Learning**. Lazy Learning will only learn from new observations where the model’s prediction was incorrect, helping to preserve disk space and memory.

**Step 5: Fine-Tuning Your Model**
- Once you have an adequately sized dataset, open the model view and click **Automatically tune model**. This will initiate a tuning process to optimize the model based on your training data.

### Preprocessors and Post Processors

#### Preprocessors clean data before it is stored in the database and handed to the machine model. Available preprocessors include:

- **Type Caster:** Converts strings (e.g., "unknown") to floats or `None`. Ensure this is the first preprocessor in the list.
- **Null Handler:** Converts `None` values to a placeholder value (e.g., `9999`). This should be the **last** preprocessor in the list.
- **Rolling Average:** Smooths out noisy data by averaging sensor values over a set period.
- **Temporal Expander:** Collects a series of past sensor values and sends them as an array to the ML model.

Coming soon:
- **Time Extractor:** Extracts time-based features (e.g., hour, day of the week) as input to the ML model.

#### Post Processors clean labels after they are calculated by the ML model, before sending them to MQTT:

- **Only Diff:** Only sends a new label to MQTT if it differs from the previous label.
- **Majority Vote:** (In development) Collects multiple predictions and only sends a label if a majority of votes match.

Coming soon:
- **Reinforcement learner:** If a series of results look like [Room1, Room1, Room2, Room1, Room1], the model will automatically learn that Room2 should have been Room1.
- **Explicit match:** If source sensors equal some set of values, ignore what the ML model predicts and provide an explicit label.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- If you are using the Home Assistant integration, confirm the app API URL is reachable from Home Assistant and that the configured MQTT broker matches ML2MQTT.
- Ensure that your sensors are consistently sending data to MQTT. The NodeRed debug node can help with this.
- Keep your labels simple and focused to improve model accuracy. The higher the number of labels, the greater the likelihood of an incorrect guess.
- If you find your results are noisy (e.g. labels jumping back and forth), just train further in that area.
- If training is too slow, be aware you can change the BLE broadcast frequency in the home assistant app at the expense of increased battery usage. For training this will work fine.
- If you forget to disable the training mode, there's the option to delete results of different time durations under the Observations menu.
